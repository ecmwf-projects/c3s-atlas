# Reproducibility of the C3S Atlas visual products

This chapter contains several notebooks to reproduce and extend parts of the figures and products provided by the [C3S Atlas](https://atlas.climate.copernicus.eu/atlas).

Table 1 indicates the notebooks included.


| Directory | Contents |
| :-------- | :------- |
|  [global_map.ipynb](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/c3s-atlas/blob/main/user-tools/global_map.ipynb) | Jupyter Notebook for reproducing global maps of climatologies or changes, including the calculation and display of uncertainty for the latter following the IPCC AR6 methodology (advanced method).
|  [time_series.ipynb](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/c3s-atlas/blob/main/user-tools/time_series.ipynb) | Jupyter Notebook for reproducing regional time series.
|  [climate_stripe.ipynb](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/c3s-atlas/blob/main/user-tools/climate_stripes.ipynb) | Jupyter Notebook for reproducing regional climate stripes.
|  [seasonal_stripe.ipynb](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/c3s-atlas/blob/main/user-tools/seasonal_stripes.ipynb) | Jupyter Notebook for reproducing regional seasonal stripes.
|  [annual_cycle.ipynb](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/c3s-atlas/blob/main/user-tools/annual_cycle.ipynb) | Jupyter Notebook for reproducing regional annual cycles.
|  [customized_regions.ipynb](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/c3s-atlas/blob/main/user-tools/customized_regions.ipynb) | Jupyter Auxiliary notebook with examples of how to produce results for customized regions defined in machine-readable formats (e.g. geojson).
|  [GWLs.ipynb](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/c3s-atlas/blob/main/user-tools/GWLs.ipynb) | Auxiliary Jupyter Notebook for calculating the Global Warming Levels (GWLs) following the IPCC AR6 methodology. This is used by previous notebooks for calculating changes for different warming levels.
